Woke up this morning closed in on all sides
Nothing doing

I feel resistance as I open my eyes
Someone's fooling.

I've found a way to break through this cellophane line

'Cause I know what's going on in my own mind.

Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box?
Am I living in a box?

Life goes in circles around and around
Circulating

I sometimes wonder what's moving underground
I'm escaping.

I've found a way to break through this cellophane line

'Cause I know what's going on in my own mind.
Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box? . . .

- Living - I can't stand no more - living
Living
Living
Am I living in a box?
Am I living
Am I living
Am I living

Am I living
Am I living
Am I living?

Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box? . . .
Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box? . . .
Am I living in a box
Am I living in a cardboard box? . . .
